# LEGO data analysis

Who hasn't played with LEGO? A fun data analysis project on LEGO. Here, I have analysed the LEGO data by taking 3 csvs that contain details about LEGO colors, sets and themes.

Analysis on:
  - The most enormous LEGO set ever created and number of parts it had.
  - The year when the first LEGO set was released and how many sets the company launched in the first year.
  - The LEGO theme which has the most sets.
  - When the LEGO company really took-off based on its product offering.
  - The number of sets and themes it released every year.
  - Whether LEGO sets grew in size and complexity over time and if older LEGO sets tend to have more parts than newer sets.
