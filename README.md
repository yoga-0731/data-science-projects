# Dr.Semmelweis Clinic data analysis

Dr.Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician who worked in the Vienna general hospital. He worked on analysing the births and deaths at two maternity clinics during 1840s. He proposed the usage of chlorine handwashing after autopsy in 1847 to prevent the bacteria from entering the mothers, which actually turned out to be pretty positive and reduced the death count by 5 times.  
This project deals with the representation of his analysis.

**Analysis on**
  - Average number of births and deaths in 1840s
  - Which clinic had the higher death ratio
  - Visualizing the death percentage before and after the proposal of handwashing

**Learnings**
  - Superimpose histograms to show differences in distributions
  - Using Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to show a graphic estimate of a distribution.
  - Using scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.
  - Highlighting different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.
  - Add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.
