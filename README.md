  This project deals with the report on college degress and their respective salaries. Got the data from Payscale (https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report) and export it as csv. This project analyses on:  
  - Which degrees have the highest starting salaries
  - Which college degrees have the lowest earnings after college
  - Which degrees have the highest earning potential
  - The lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint (i.e., the degrees whose minimum and maximum salaries don't differ much)
  - Which branch of degree has more earnings -  Business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science)
